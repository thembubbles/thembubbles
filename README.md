# Welcome to my personal webpage

Here is where you can learn more about my current work, past projects, future ideas, and a little about my interests.
Views and opinions are my own and only represent my tiny point of view.

Feel free to reuse the codes and form, but for the content, please cite the original source (Me).

This page was built using Jekyll themes minimal-mistakes, and I borrowed design ideas from friends, colleagues, and random people from the internet.
